# MaskDetector
This Project is about whether a Person is Wearing Mask or not

I have used Open-cv harcascade for the face detection detection. The Logic is 

while(true) <br>
{

  if (person)
  
    {
    
      if mouth is visible
      
      {
      
      speak("Wear the Mask")
      
      }
      
      else
      
      {
      
      speak("Move Forward")
      
      }
      
     }
     
  else
  
  {
  
  break
  
  }
  
}
