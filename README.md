# MaskDetector
This Project is about whether a Person is Wearing Mask or not

I have used Open-cv harcascade for the face detection detection. The Logic is 

while(true)<br>
>{
  if (person)<br>
 >>{
    if mouth is visible<br>
    >>>  {
      speak("Wear the Mask")<br>
      }
      else
    >>>  {
      speak("Move Forward")<br>
      }
     }
  else
  >>{
  break
  }
}
